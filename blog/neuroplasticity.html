Once neuroplasicity was widely recognised it became understood that our brains continued to change throughout our entire lives. With practice, learning a new instrument or language causes our brains to actually grow and create new connections between neurons. This is call positive placisity and is used in learning as well as in recovery for people with disorders.

While neuroplasicity comes from the scientific fields the growth mindset comes from the psycology. The growth mindset is the idea that by knowing your brain is developing and growing these connections through neuroplasicity we can have a positive and more productice mindset towards learning. Effort and difficulty in the growth mindset are considered a good thing, it shows that you are making the connections and that you are learning.
