    <h1>Learning Plan</h1>
    
    <h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
    <p>My long term goal is to move into a field where I can build tools to help people create their visions. I have spent a lot of time in the 3d produciton community and would like to build tools for Blender that can exstend its capabilities</p>
    
    <h2>Strengths and Limitations</h2>
    <p>I am able to stay calm under pressure and can prioritize well. I am generally an optimistic person who can break down difficult situations with logical thinking.</p>
    <p>My biggest limitation is probably getting bored of something and losing motivation. I also find it difficult to put into words what i mean or to define my understanding of a concept. Remaining calm and optimistic can lead to me leaving things to the last minute</p>
    
    <h2>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
    <p>I would like to improve on communicating my thoughts more clearly</p>
    
    <h2>how you will manage your workload in this programme</h2>
    <p>I will stick to a set time for starting. I think getting into a routine for beginning is the best thing for because getting started is the hardest part for me.</p>
