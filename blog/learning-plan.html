    <h2>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
    <p>To build interactive software or tools that help people acclompish creative tasks</p>
    
    <h2>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h2>
    <p> Biggest strength is that I get along with people easily and feel comfortable around all kinds of people. Limitations are probably sticking to a more rigid time schedule</p>

    <h2>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h2>
    <p>communicating with people about things that aren't to do with programming.</p>

    <h2>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
    <p>Better be able to articulate my thoughts to others. </p>

    <h2>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h2>
    <p>To be understanding and helpful. To guide me in direction of some interesting areas of discovery</p>

    <h2>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h2>
    <p>To come out confident that I can continue to learn anything I'm interested in within programming</p>
    
    <h1>Learning Plan</h1>
    
    <h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
    <p>My long term goal is to move into a field where I can build tools to help people create their visions. I have spent a lot of time in the 3d produciton community and would like to build tools for Blender that can exstend its capabilities</p>
    
    <h2>Strengths and Limitations</h2>
    <p>I am able to stay calm under pressure and can prioritize well. I am generally an optimistic person who can break down difficult situations with logical thinking.</p>
    <p>My biggest limitation is probably getting bored of something and losing motivation. I also find it difficult to put into words what i mean or to define my understanding of a concept. Remaining calm and optimistic can lead to me leaving things to the last minute</p>
    
    <h2>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
    <p>I would like to improve on communicating my thoughts more clearly.
    </p>
    
    <h2>how you will manage your workload in this programme</h2>
    <p>I will stick to a set time for starting. I think getting into a routine for beginning is the best thing for because getting started is the hardest part for me.</p>
