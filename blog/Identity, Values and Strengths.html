    <h1>Identity, Values and Strengths</h1>
    <h2>Influences on Values & Identity</h2>
    <p> I grew up in Napier around a community of skaters. I think this sub-culture was where i got most of my values from. 
      It's important to me that I can hold my own and solve my own issues through self analysis. I hold loyalty as probably 
      the most important value. Creativity was more often thought of higher than perfection, hard work and grinding through 
      frustration coinsided with an attitude of never giving up</p>
    <h2>Strengths and Limitations</h2>
    <p> I am opitimistic and always have the mind set that things will work out in the end.
      This can be both a positive and a negative as I don't find myself stressed often but 
      it also means I have trouble with time managment and leave things to the last minute.
      I often has spontanious energy for completing tasks which makes it difficult to manage time well.
      I assume often that other people understand if they have done some well or not so i don't often give 
      out compliments or advice unless I'm asked.
    </p>
    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p> I used to work with someone in a really busy bar that wasn't pulling their weight and slacking off while everyone else was working hard. They told me they got paid the same whether they worked hard or not so they didn't care. I explained to them the idea of work as a percentage and that by working harder other peoples sense of value would go up. If someone else has to work harder and do 150% of their work it's like they are getting paid half as much. I wanted to convey that by him working harder as part of the team a low pay of the job could feel like higher because we are doing less work for the dollar. They agreed and worked harder but it didn't really last longer than a week. I think because i'm not much of a natural leader I didn't really follow up with him because I felt like I had already said it once it didn't need to be said again. Thinking back i probably could have reiterated this point to him later that week.</p>
