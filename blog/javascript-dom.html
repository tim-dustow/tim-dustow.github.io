    <h1>Control flow and loops</h1>
    <p>Control flow is the path that the computer executes the code, like a river flowing it has one direction. Loops however are able to interupt this the control flow like a detour. When the flow hits a loop it will repeat on that path until it completes the cycle. This could be compared to a jogger running on the spot while they wait for the green light. The code is still executing but it needs to wait for the green light to continue down on it's flow.</p>
    <h1>The DOM</h1>
    <p>The DOM (Document Object Model) is a tree structure that is made up of parent and children elements. It can be used to access specific nodes of the tree within a document. This allows for a non-destructive workflow when working on documents such as HTML. The DOM can be used to inject and manipulate information within the document through the use of ID's and classes.</p>
    <h1>Arrays and Objects</h1>
    <p>Arrays are used to store multiple items that are assigned and can be recalled by and index number. These are like a shopping list. The list is the array and the list contains items such as milk, bread, butter etc.
      Objects are used to represent a thing that holds multiple properties or characteristics. This could be a character in a game who would be the object and the properties they hold could be age, height, name etc.</p>
    <h1>Functions</h1>
    <p>Functions are perfect for reusing code. It is like grouping a bunch of commands together into one macro button, like creating a shortcut. Functions can contain multiple commands inside and only have to be called by name meaning you only have to do the work once.s</p>
