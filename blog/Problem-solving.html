    <h1>Problem Solving</h1>
    
    <h2>What was the problem?</h2>
    <p>
      The strings 'Buzz' and 'buzz' were not being passed the same with the == operator
    </p>
    
    <h2>What problem-solving techniques did you use?</h2>
    <p>
      reading the console
      then googling the == operator
    </p>
    
    <h2>How did you feel throughout the process?</h2>
    <p>
      I felt confused because my understanding was not lining up with the actual result 
    </p>
    
    <h2>What did you learn?</h2>
    <p>
      I learnt that == only removes the type such as string and attribute from the equation but strings with uppercase compared to lowercase still keep their individuality
      understanding of == still case sensitive Buzz buzz buZz
      read console log -----changed all to uppercase

    <h3>Pseudocode:</h3>
    <p>
      I found pseudocode very useful for creating the initial idea of how I was going to solve the problem. Breaking it down into smaller parts and describing what each part of the code was doing in each step helped with problem solving later on. If I didn't know the operator of method I needed I could write what I was trying to achieve and put that into a search engine to find a solution.
    </p>
    <h3>Trying something</h3>
      
    <p>
      I feel least comfortable with trying something because sometimes I don't fully understand what I'm doing and worry about how it could affect the rest of the code. A time where trying something did work out was in one of the challenges where the end result was more elegant if I used the not equal to operator(!==) instead of the equal to operator(==). Sometimes working in the negative vs the positive doesn't matter but sometimes approaching a problem from a different angle can make the solution more obvious or simple.
    </p>
    <h3>Rubber ducky method</h3> 
    <p>
      I did use this a couple of times in conjunction with reading back through my pseudocode and this did often help for me to find obvious mistakes in my thought process.
    </p>
    <h3>Reading error messages</h3>
    <p>
      Error messages when they were running through the tests saved me a lot this week. When it showed the expected result vs the actual result I was able to see clearly what was wrong or what was missing from my thought process. Error messages have also been helpful for syntax errors like missing brackets and extra commas etc.
    </p>
    <h3>Console.logging</h3> 
    <p>
      I use console.log frequently for double checking the result is what I think it is. It has also been helpful in one case when I was getting the average of some numbers, once I saw how many decimal points were in the result I was able to reduce it to just one. Without console logging I wouldn't have even thought of that as a problem.
    </p>
    <h3>Googling</h3>
    <p>
      Pseudocode leads into googling for me. If I know clearly what you want to achieve it makes googling a lot easier. Also getting a full solution to my problem is not really helpful with understanding what each part is really doing.
    </p>
    <h3>Asking your peers for help</h3>
    <p>
      Asking for help from my peers is probably what I find the hardest. I usually leave this as a last resort once I've exhausted my other options first. I don't like to bother people unless it's necessary. I could probably use this more often though because it can end up benifiting both people involved.
    </p>
    <h3>Asking coaches for help</h3>
    <p>
      I haven't used this one a lot because like asking peers I usually use this one last. I almost always get to a solution before getting to this point
    </p>
    <h3>Improving your process with reflection</h3>
    <p>
      The reflection often came after trying things and finding different approaches like taking a negative approach vs a positive one. Reflecting back on this added another method I could use to get better solutions to future problems.  Furthermore reflecting on when I got stuck can prevent further blockages. In the situation where I was misunderstanding how the == operator actually functioned, I now know that something like that could be the cause of a problem and I will examine my understanding of operator in my solutions in the future when it is not working.
