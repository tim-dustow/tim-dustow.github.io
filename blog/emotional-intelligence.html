    <h1>Thoughts on Emotional Intelligence</h1>
    <p> Emotional intelligence is an important part of interacting with people in the world. Now that we have the ability to interact with people we have never met through social media we can have a bubbles intruded on. This can breed a lot of negativity and because of the lack of context(not knowing the other person) can affect our own mental states. Practicing mindfulness helps to see things clearly and have control over how you feel and react to peoples comments. How you take criticism or advice, or how you percieve someones comments can be up to you.

    <p>In the past people often say to me that i'm "so chill" or they assume that I smoke weed. Since I never smoke weed I like to think this is more to do with my emotional intelligence. I think people have a calm demenor to them if they have high emotional intelligence probably because they feel comfortable or in control of the sitituation they find themselve in. Seeing people not react agressively back towards agressive people sometimes gets stereotyped as weak we in fact you can see the strength in how calm they are.</p>
