  <h1>Reflections on Foundations</h1>
  <h2>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h2>
  <p>
    <li>That I can enjoy learning something from the beginning and still enjoy the feeling of being a beginner</li>
    <li>Stubborn about solving a problem and can't leave it</li>
    <li>I enjoyed seeing connections to other fields such as music in programming. It showed what I really enjoy about subjects is more the core underlying attributes rather than the surface</li>
  </p>

  <h2>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
  <p>
    Values are important in defining how you work while studing. Loyality to helping others in your group succeed, Accountability for completing your tasks properly, especially in self learning enviroments. Optimism leads to a good learning eviroment for yourself each task completed feels fulfilling. 
    Self-Awareness allows us to be critical of ourselves realising out limitations, when we're stressed or just checking in on on our mindset. This helps to keep things on track knowing when to ask for help, when to take a break or when to take a different approach. 
    Empathy plays a large part in problem solving. Understanding and being aware of someone elses feelings and thoughts will give you direction and understanding of how someone else might interact with your code.

  <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
  <p>
    I was probably most suprised at how normal everything was. I didn't realised that mindfullness wasn't really practiced by everyone at least in some compacity. Most things we learned highlighted what was what made you successful at things but maybe I hadn't realised what exactly it was that i was doing.
  </p>
  
  <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
  <p>
      Putting into words how you feel. Often when I write it down it doesn't really reflect how I truly feel or think. Sometimes it feels like without context it isn't quite the right shade.
  </p>

  <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h2>
  <p>
    Anyone can learn the syntax of programming because it's more about memorizing phrases. Having good core skills will set you apart and will help make those around you better too. Programming can be frustrating, so getting through the frustration can be the hardest part, more so than actually solving the problem.
  </p>
  <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>
  <p>
    I wouldn't say wasted time but I think I would have benifitted from it more if i was younger and hadn't already experienced the concepts in other fields. I think learning the core skills else where is what lead me to learning at Dev Academy. I think with how foundations is structured you can always spend more time programming if you wanted to on your own. I found doing both at the same time pulled me out of my emmersion which could be good or bad. It gave more perspective of the bigger picture but it slowed down the learning of the fundamental parts of programming for me such as loops and functions.
